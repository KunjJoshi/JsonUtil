• Created a JSON Parsing tool that validates and prints JSON based data to support a visualizing tool for better
understanding of JSON Data; tested over 250 JSON Datasets.

• Included support for 3 types of JSON key-value pairs: Strings, Arrays, and JSON Objects, ensuring seamless
handling of nested structures for enhanced usability.

• Formulated an optimized Tree-based Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm, achieving efficient data retrieval in O(log
N) time complexity and enhancing search performance by 30%
